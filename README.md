# LoomasPlugins

Plugins for [Loomas](https://github.com/loomas-apps/Loomas), the tool that extracts data from video: image, sound, text, context and search.

Loomas's core does very little itself (it reads recipes, opens a video, extracts audio and keeps the results). Everything that finds something in the media is a plugin: a separate program that Loomas starts when a recipe calls it. A plugin can be written in any language. This repository holds the plugins that are developed alongside Loomas, and the documentation of how to write one.

Work happens on the `dev` branch; `main` holds what was released (each plugin has its own releases with a `.loomp` package for every platform it runs on). To add a plugin or change one, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Writing a plugin

Read [docs/plugin-protocol.md](docs/plugin-protocol.md): the manifest (`plugin.json`), the messages a plugin exchanges with Loomas, and an example exchange. A plugin needs nothing from this repository to work; it only has to speak the protocol.

To hand a plugin to someone, pack it as a `.loomp` file: [docs/loomp-format.md](docs/loomp-format.md) says what goes in it and what an installer checks (`loomas plugins install cat-sounds.loomp`).

With Claude Code, open this repository and ask for the `plugin-author` agent (or the `write-a-plugin` skill): both are in `.claude/` and work from these documents, and use the `loomas` tool and its MCP server when they are installed.

Then [docs/writing-good-plugins.md](docs/writing-good-plugins.md): guidance, not rules, on what makes a plugin pleasant to use in a workflow (report failures as failures, handle `cancel`, stay predictable).

## What is here

| Plugin | Language | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [speech-to-text](apps/speech-to-text) | Python | writes down the sentences said, with their times (faster-whisper; can be run a window at a time) |
| [sound-volume](apps/sound-volume) | Rust | how loud a sound is over time, with the low, mid and high bands, and where it is silent |
| [sound-graph](apps/sound-graph) | Rust | draws the waves of a sound as an SVG, with the sentences marked |
| [sound-clean](apps/sound-clean) | Rust | takes steady noise out of a sound and hands the cleaned sound to the next plugin |
| [thumbnail](apps/thumbnail) | Rust | chooses the pictures that show a video best (sharp, well exposed, not all from one scene) |
| [sound-events](apps/sound-events) | Rust | finds the sounds a video has from the 521 AudioSet classes (meow, bark, siren, speech, music...) with a small tagger and no language model: one event each time a sound is heard, with its time and a clip of it |
| [speakers](apps/speakers) | Rust | finds who speaks when (pyannote segmentation and WeSpeaker voice prints, no language model); each voice gets a pattern file and a sample to listen to, and a pattern given back with a name names that voice in later videos and learns from it |
| [voice-tone](apps/voice-tone) | Rust | how each stretch of speech is said: its loudness against the usual speech of the video (low, normal, loud) and the emotion of the voice (wav2vec2 classifier, 8 emotions), for the sentences of speech-to-text, the turns of speakers, or windows |
| [face-emotion](apps/face-emotion) | Rust | finds the faces in a video (YuNet), follows each one and gives the stretches where it keeps one expression (angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, surprise); it never says who a face is |
| [narrator](apps/narrator) | Rust | writes what other plugins found (sentences, speakers, voice tone, face expressions, movements, things in view) as a timeline of plain sentences, with templates and no model |
| [voice-extractor](apps/voice-extractor) | Rust | splits a video's sound into the voice and the rest with a speech-enhancement network (DeepFilterNet3); each track can go straight to the next plugin. Optional: it does not reliably improve speech-to-text (see its README) |
| [visual-phrases](apps/visual-phrases) | Rust | finds when a phrase describes what a video shows ("two cats sleeping on a couch", "a red car") with an image-text model and no language model: any phrase, no fixed list of classes; one appearance each time it holds, with its first picture and time |
| [music-sync](apps/music-sync) | Rust | finds where a music starts inside a video's sound, so a high-quality copy of the music can replace the video's (with `media.replaceAudio` and its `offsetMs`) |
| [coco-objects](apps/coco-objects) | Rust | finds the things a video shows from the 80 COCO classes (cat, person, car...) with a fast detector and no language model: one appearance for each time a class shows up, with its first picture and time |
| [sentiment-analysis](apps/sentiment-analysis) | Rust | rates how positive, neutral or negative sentences are, in 12 languages, with a small DistilBERT; it rates the wording and not distress, and says so |
| [movement](apps/movement) | Rust | lists the movements of the people in a video (still, walking, running, falling, arms up, and so on) from body positions, with RTMPose small, RTMPose medium or MoveNet as the user chooses |
| [on-screen-text](apps/on-screen-text) | Rust | reads the text a video shows (titles, burnt-in subtitles, signs) with PaddleOCR, for 11 scripts: what is written, when it is on the screen and where |
| [video-upscale](apps/video-upscale) | Rust | makes a video two or four times larger with a Real-ESRGAN network (general, anime or photo) or plain Lanczos scaling, with no language model; runs on the graphics card the host grants; the new video has no sound |
| [crisis-moments](apps/crisis-moments) | Rust | finds moments where a person may be in distress or in conflict, for a person to look at (screaming, shouting, crying, struggling to breathe, the sounds of a blow, words of distress or about harming oneself, aggressive words; in English, Portuguese, Spanish, French and German) from what other steps found: sentences, sounds and loudness; fixed rules, no model; "moments to review", never a diagnosis or a verdict, and not a safety system |
| [video-audio](apps/video-audio) | Rust | writes the sound of a video as an audio file (wav, flac, opus, mp3) in the sample rate, channels, stretch and track you choose, or at a loudness you set (LUFS), with your own FFmpeg |
| [example-hits](apps/example-hits) | Rust | the reference plugin: pretends to find things |

Shared code: [libs/plugin-sdk](libs/plugin-sdk) speaks the protocol for a Rust plugin (answers `hello` with its capabilities, runs every call on its own thread, cancel, progress, the work folder), [libs/sound-reader](libs/sound-reader) reads the sound Loomas decoded (or any common audio file) and writes a sound for the next plugin, and [libs/frame-reader](libs/frame-reader) reads the pictures Loomas decoded. The speech plugin has the same in Python.

## Layout

```
apps/
  <plugin-name>/          one folder per plugin, named as in its plugin.json
    plugin.json           the manifest
    README.md             what it finds, its parameters, what it needs installed
    ...                   its own code, in its own language
docs/
  plugin-protocol.md      the protocol, version 2
  writing-good-plugins.md guidance for plugin authors
  loomp-format.md           the .loomp package: one plugin in one file
```

The repository is a [MonoSmith](https://github.com/monosmith-app/monosmith) workspace, so each plugin is a smith project (`smith add app <name> --lang <language>`) and `smith lint`, `smith test` and `smith build` run for all of them. Give Loomas the `apps` folder with `--plugins apps`.

[apps/example-hits](apps/example-hits) is a reference plugin in Rust that pretends to find things; copy it to start your own.

A plugin brings its own runtime and dependencies, or documents them in its README. Nothing in one plugin's folder may depend on another plugin's folder.

Every decision, idea and task is a GitHub issue in this repository.
